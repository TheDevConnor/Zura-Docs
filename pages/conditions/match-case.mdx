# Match Case Statments
Match case statments are another way of doing conditional logic. They are similar to switch statements in other languages. They are useful when you have a lot of different cases to check for. They are also useful when you want to return a value from the case statement. 

```zura
have a := 1;

match(day_number) {
    case 0: return "Sunday";
    case 1: return "Monday";
    case 2: return "Tuesday";
    case 3: return "Wednesday";
    case 4: return "Thursday";
    case 5: return "Friday";
    case 6: return "Saturday";
default:
    return "Invalid day number" + toString(day_number);
}
```
