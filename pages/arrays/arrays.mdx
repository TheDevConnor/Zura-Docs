# Array Operations in Zura

In this example, we'll explore array operations in the "zura" programming language. We have an array named "a" and we'll demonstrate various operations related to indexing, popping, and pushing elements.

## Array Initialization

```zura
have a := [8, 9, 4, 1];
```
In Zura, arrays are collections of elements. Here, we've initialized an array "a" with the values `[8, 9, 4, 1]`.

## Array Indexing

```zura
info a[0]; // 8
```
Array elements are indexed starting from 0. In this line, we use square brackets to access the element at index 0 of the array "a," which is `8`. The `info` statement prints the value `8` to the console.

## Array Popping

```zura
info a <- 0; // 8
```
The `<-` operator is used to remove and return the element at a specific index. In this case, we're removing and returning the element at index 0 of the array "a," which is `8`. The `info` statement prints the value `1` to the console.

## Array Pushing

```zura
info a -> 5 @ 0; // [5, 9, 4, 1]
```
The `->` operator is used to insert an element at a specific index. In this case, we're inserting the value `5` at index 0 of the array "a." The `info` statement prints the array `[5, 9, 4, 1]` to the console.
