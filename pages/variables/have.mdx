# Have keyword
In the zura programming language we use the `have` keyword to declare a mutable variable. The `have` keyword is followed by the variable name then the `:=` and then the value of the variable. The value of the variable can be any expression.

```zura
have x := 5
```


To redefine a variable you can use the `=` operator.

```zura
x = 10
```
