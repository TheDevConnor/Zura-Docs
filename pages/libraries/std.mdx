# Standard Library Documentation

The `std` library provides a collection of native functions that offer various standard utilities and operations for working with data in the Zura programming language.

## List of Available Functions

### Length of Data
1. `len(data)`: Returns the length of the specified data, such as strings, arrays, or other iterable structures.

### Timing Functions
2. `clock()`: Returns the current system time in milliseconds, allowing for basic time-related calculations.

### Conversion Functions
3. `toString(value)`: Converts a value to its string representation.
4. `toNumber(value)`: Converts a value to its numerical representation.

## Usage Examples

Here are a few examples of how you can use some of the functions provided by the `std` library:

### Length of Data
```zura
have array_length := len([1, 2, 3, 4]);
have string_length := len("Hello, Zura!");
```
This will return the length of the specified data, 
such as strings, arrays, or other iterable structures.

### Timing Functions
```zura
have start_time := clock();
// Do some work here...
have end_time := clock();
have elapsed_time := end_time - start_time;
info "Elapsed time: " + toString(elapsed_time) + "ms";
```
This will return the current system time in milliseconds, 
allowing for basic time-related calculations.

### Conversion Functions
```zura
have string_value := toString(123);
have number_value := toNumber("123");
```
This will convert a value to its string or 
numerical representation.
