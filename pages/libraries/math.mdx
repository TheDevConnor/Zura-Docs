# Math Library Documentation

The `mathlib` is a collection of native functions that provide various mathematical operations for use within the Zura programming language. These functions cover a wide range of mathematical computations, from basic arithmetic to trigonometric and logarithmic functions.

## List of Available Functions

### Random Number Generation
1. `mathRandom`: Generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 1.
2. `mathRandomRange(min, max)`: Generates a random floating-point number within a specified range.

### Rounding and Truncation
3. `mathRound(number)`: Rounds a floating-point number to the nearest integer.
4. `mathFloor(number)`: Rounds a floating-point number down to the nearest integer.
5. `mathCeil(number)`: Rounds a floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

### Absolute Value
6. `mathAbs(number)`: Returns the absolute value of a number.

### Logarithmic Functions
7. `mathLog(number)`: Calculates the natural logarithm of a number.
8. `mathLog10(number)`: Calculates the base 10 logarithm of a number.

### Square Root
9. `mathSqrt(number)`: Calculates the square root of a number.

### Trigonometric Functions
10. `mathSin(angle)`: Calculates the sine of an angle (in radians).
11. `mathCos(angle)`: Calculates the cosine of an angle (in radians).
12. `mathTan(angle)`: Calculates the tangent of an angle (in radians).

### Additional Trigonometric Functions
13. `mathCsc(angle)`: Calculates the cosecant of an angle (in radians).
14. `mathSec(angle)`: Calculates the secant of an angle (in radians).
15. `mathCot(angle)`: Calculates the cotangent of an angle (in radians).

### Inverse Trigonometric Functions
16. `mathAsin(value)`: Calculates the arcsine (inverse sine) of a value (returns angle in radians).
17. `mathAcos(value)`: Calculates the arccosine (inverse cosine) of a value (returns angle in radians).
18. `mathAtan(value)`: Calculates the arctangent (inverse tangent) of a value (returns angle in radians).

### Miscellaneous
19. `mathFastFib(n)`: Calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using a fast algorithm.

## Usage Examples

Here are a few examples of how you can use some of the functions provided by the `mathlib`:

```zura
// Generate a random number between 0 and 1
random_number := mathRandom();

// Calculate the square root of a number
sqrt_result := mathSqrt(25);

// Calculate the sine of an angle in radians
sine_value := mathSin(0.5);

// Calculate the natural logarithm of a number
log_result := mathLog(10);


These functions are designed to assist you in performing a wide 
range of mathematical computations within your Zura programs. 
Whether you need to generate random numbers, perform trigonometric 
calculations, or work with logarithms, the mathlib has you 
covered.
