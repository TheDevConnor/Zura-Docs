# File System Library Documentation

The `fs` library provides native functions that allow you to interact with files and perform file-related operations in the Zura programming language.

## List of Available Functions

### Reading Files
1. `fsReadFile(filename)`: Reads the contents of a file and returns its content as a string.

### Writing Files
2. `fsWriteFile(filename, content)`: Writes the specified content to a file, creating the file if it doesn't exist.

### Generating Files
3. `fsGenerateFile(filename, content)`: Generates a new file with the specified content. If the file already exists, its content will be overwritten.

### Deleting Files
4. `fsDeleteFile(filename)`: Deletes the specified file.

## Usage Examples

Here are a few examples of how you can use some of the functions provided by the `fs` library:

### Reading a File
```zura
file_content := fsReadFile("example.txt");
info file_content;


In this example, the `fsReadFile` function is used to read the 
content of the file named "example.txt." The content is then 
printed to the console using the `info` statement.
