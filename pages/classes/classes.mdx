title: Understanding the Simple Class Example in Zura
---

In the given example, we're introducing the concept of classes in the "zura" programming language through a straightforward 
scenario involving a class named "Toast."

## Class Declaration
```zura
class Toast {}
```
In Zura, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific attributes and behaviors. Here, we've defined a `class` 
called "Toast" using the class keyword, followed by the class name and an empty set of curly braces. This serves as a 
starting point for creating instances of the "Toast" class.

## Creating an Instance of a Class
```zura
have toast := Toast();
```
To use a class, we create instances (objects) of that class. In this line of code, we declare a variable named "toast" 
using the `have` keyword and initialize it with an instance of the "Toast" class by invoking the class with parentheses 
`Toast()`. This instance represents a particular "Toast" object.

## Adding Attributes
```zura
info toast.jam := "strawberry"; // add attribute "jam" to toast object, and prints "strawberry"
```
Classes allow us to define attributes (also known as properties or fields) that hold specific data for each instance. 
In this case, we've added an attribute named "jam" to the "toast" instance and assigned the value "grape" to it.

The info keyword is used to output information to the console. When we use toast.jam within the info statement, 
it refers to the "jam" attribute of the "toast" instance.

When you run this code, the console will display "grape," indicating that the "jam" attribute of the "toast" 
instance is set to "grape."
