# Class Function Example in Zura

In this example, we'll explore the usage of class functions within the "zura" programming language. The scenario involves 
a class named "Person" and demonstrates how to define and call class functions.

## Class Function Definition

```zura
class Person {
  sayName() {
    info this.name;
  }
}
```
In Zura, a class function is a method defined within a class that can be called on instances of that class. 
Here, we've defined a class named "Person." Inside the class, the `sayName()` function is defined. This function 
uses the `info` keyword to output the value of the `name` attribute using the `this` keyword.

## Creating an Instance and Assigning Attributes

```zura
have jane := Person();
jane.name := "Jane";
```
To use the class, we create an instance named "jane" of the "Person" class. We then set the `name` 
attribute of the "jane" instance to "Jane."

## Calling the Class Function

```zura
have method := jane.sayName;
method(); // Prints "Jane".
```
In the above code, we create a variable named "method" and assign it the value of the `sayName` function of the 
"jane" instance. This value is essentially a reference to the function. When we call `method()` on the next line, 
it executes the `sayName()` function, which outputs the value of the `name` attribute of the "jane" instance, 
resulting in "Jane" being printed to the console.
