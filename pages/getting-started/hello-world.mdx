# Your first Program

Now that we understand the basics of the commands we can start writing our first program. We will start with a simple program that prints "Hello World" to the screen. To do this we will use the `print` command. The `print` command takes a string as an argument and prints it to the screen. A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. For example, `"Hello World"` is a string. The `print` command is used like this:

```zu

// in zura we define variables using the := operator
have x := "Hello World"; 

// in zura we also use info to print to the screen
info x;
```
